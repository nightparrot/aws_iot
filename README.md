# aws_iot
inspired by osalkk example

using Python 2.7.11

Trying to push temperature data from an Arduino to Raspberry Pi (hub) to AWS IoT for data visualization or further to an app.

At the moment I am just trying to send static data from Pi to AWS.

All other parts are working currently.

After successfully publishing to AWS, I will then add the local mqtt subscription to this python code
