# aws_iot
inspired by osalkk example

using Python 2.7.11

Trying to push temperature data from and Arduino to Raspberry Pi (hub) to AWS IoT.

At the moment I am just trying to send static data from Pi to AWS.

All other parts are working currently.

After successfully publishing to AWS, I will then add the local mqtt subscription to this python code
